collarcmds
==========

This repository contains the code for the OpenCollar web remote server (the
thing that lets commands be sent across the grid from owner hud to collar).

The initial commit in this repository has the code pulled from App Engine on
Nov 5, 2011.  It's what was running for a long time.

Later commits disable the server functionality because of the increase in
Google's prices.

So if you want to use this code to set up your own remote server, you probably
want to roll back to the very first commit.
